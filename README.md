# About the Project

## Inspiration

LifeLens was inspired by the challenge many students and young people face when trying to plan their futures. We saw a need for a supportive, judgment-free space where anyone could explore their interests, ask questions, and get career advice—instantly and anonymously. The idea was to make career counseling as easy as chatting with a friend, powered by AI.

## How We Built It

- **Backend:** FastAPI serves as the backbone, handling API requests and integrating with OpenAI’s GPT for the chatbot logic.
- **Frontend:** Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a multi-page layout, modern navigation, and a dedicated chatbot page.
- **Persistence:** Chat history is stored in the browser for a seamless user experience.
- **Deployment:** The project is structured for easy local development and future cloud deployment.
